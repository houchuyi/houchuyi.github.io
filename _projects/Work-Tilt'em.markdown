Tilt'em News is a groundbreaking app that empowers users to break free from echo chambers and gain a well-rounded understanding of news topics. By simply tilting your device—left for left-wing, right for right-wing, or flat for a centrist view—you can easily access diverse political perspectives on the same article. This intuitive feature ensures that you are exposed to multiple viewpoints, helping you form a more informed and balanced opinion on the issues that matter.
