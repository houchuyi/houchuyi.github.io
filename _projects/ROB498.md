In this project, we propose RoboKart, an intelligent robotic shopping cart designed to improve the grocery shopping experience and address the decline in customer satisfaction since the pandemic. RoboKart includes features such as customer-following, a shopping guide, and auto-checkout to create a seamless, tech-driven experience. We focus on the shopping guide feature, which we tested in a simulation environment, successfully navigating through different store settings. Our goal is to enhance customer satisfaction and reduce revenue losses in the retail sector through innovative robotics technology.
