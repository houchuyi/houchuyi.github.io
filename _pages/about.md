Hi, I am Chuyi (Sky) Hou. I am an HCI researcher and a Signal Processing and Machine Learning Engineer at Unmodal Research Inc. With a Master of Engineering in Mechanical and Industrial Engineering and a Bachelor of Applied Science in Engineering Science with a Robotics Option, I have a strong foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of engineering.

My professional journey includes significant experience as a project team member and research assistant at the University of Toronto, where I honed my skills in Python, SQL, MATLAB, and ROS. At Unmodal Research Inc., I further developed my expertise in C programming, microcontroller programming, firmware development, and working with a wide range of sensors such as EMG, IMU, IR cameras, and force-sensitive resistors (FSR). I have also expanded my technical skill set to include Swift UI iOS app programming, UI/UX design, LLM cloud development and deployment, and Python GUI programming. Additionally, I have refined my creative abilities in product photography and video editing.

My experience spans developing cutting-edge Computer Vision and Machine Learning projects. Driven by a passion for innovation, I am dedicated to advancing the fields of signal processing and machine learning, leveraging my diverse skills to solve complex challenges and contribute to impactful technological advancements.

My research interest lies in:

Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), focusing on creating algorithms, tools, and models for seamless human-computer interactions. My work also explores UI/UX design and innovating ways to transform text-based interactions with large language models (LLMs) into more intuitive, text-less experiences for better outcomes.
