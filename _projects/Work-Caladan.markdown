Unmodal Research Inc.

Caladan is an advanced sales force training platform powered by large language models (LLMs). It enables sales personnel to engage in realistic practice sessions with AI-simulated potential clients. By gathering contextual data about the market and target clients, Caladan creates detailed client personas, allowing sales teams to refine their skills in a controlled environment. This approach makes sales training more efficient and effective, helping teams to better prepare for real-world interactions.

I was responsible for the backend development of the Caladan platform, focusing on data gathering, LLM prompting, interaction, and cloud deployment. My work involved creating robust systems to collect and process contextual data about target clients and markets, which was then used to generate accurate and effective client personas for sales training. I also developed the infrastructure for seamless interaction with large language models, ensuring responsive and realistic simulations. Additionally, I handled the cloud deployment, ensuring the platform is scalable, secure, and efficient for users.
