My broad interests:
- Applied Machine Learning, with a focus on developing models and algorithms to solve real-world problems across various domains.
- Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and machine learning to create more intuitive, efficient, and impactful user experiences.

I carry 2 years of experience applying machine learning techniques to real-world challenges, particularly in developing innovative solutions that enhance user interaction and system performance. I am currently a Machine Learning Engineer at Unmodal Research Inc., and I hold a Master of Engineering in Mechanical and Industrial Engineering as well as a Bachelor of Applied Science in Engineering Science with a Robotics Option from the University of Toronto. My strong engineering background equips me with both theoretical knowledge and practical experience in applying machine learning to various domains.

My professional journey includes roles as a project team member and research assistant at the University of Toronto, where I honed my skills in Python, SQL, MATLAB, and machine learning algorithms. At Unmodal Research Inc., I expanded my expertise in C programming, microcontroller programming, firmware development, and integrating machine learning with sensor technologies such as EMG, IMU, and IR cameras. I have also broadened my technical skills to include cloud development and deployment of LLMs, Python GUI programming, and full-stack machine learning integration.

Driven by a passion for innovation, I have worked on cutting-edge Machine Learning projects that bridge theory with real-world applications. I am dedicated to advancing machine learning solutions, leveraging my diverse skill set to tackle complex challenges and drive impactful technological advancements.
